# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few small guidelines to make collaboration easy:

- If you want to suggest changes to the README, open an issue or a pull request with a short description.
- Keep PRs focused and small — one feature/fix per PR.
- Use clear commit messages and include a short description of what changed and why.
- For code contributions, include tests where appropriate and document any new configuration.
- Be respectful and constructive in reviews.

If you're unsure where to start, open an issue and tag it with "good first issue" and I'll take a look.

Thank you — I appreciate your help! 🚀
